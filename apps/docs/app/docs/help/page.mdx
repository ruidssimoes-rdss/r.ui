### Does r/ui support Expo?

Yes! r/ui works with Expo out of the box. No additional configuration required.

### Can I use r/ui with web-only React?

r/ui is built for React Native and React Native Web. For web-only React projects, consider using shadcn/ui or Radix UI directly.

### How do I use r/ui with TypeScript?

r/ui is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages needed.

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from '@r-ui/react-native'

// Full autocomplete and type checking
const MyButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => (
  <Button variant="primary" {...props} />
)
```

### What's the bundle size?

r/ui is tree-shakeable. You only pay for what you import:

import { Button } from '@r-ui/react-native'
```
